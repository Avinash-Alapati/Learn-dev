My Web Development Learning Journey
This repository is a living record of my progress in mastering web development.
Here, I document what I learn each day — from core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts to building dynamic, responsive applications with modern frameworks.
Each commit reflects a step forward, whether it’s a small code snippet, a complete project, or a new concept I’ve explored. 
This collection not only serves as my personal roadmap but also as a resource I can revisit to reinforce my skills. 
It’s a testament to my commitment to growth, continuous practice, and passion for creating on the web.
