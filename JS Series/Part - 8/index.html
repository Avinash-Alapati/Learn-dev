    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
    <p id="description">
        In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and
        head writer Stan Lee was looking for a new superhero idea. He said the
        teenage demand for comic books and a character with whom they could identify 
        led to the creation fo Spider-Man.As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man 
        as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing in comic books.

        In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter 
        the Spider as a great influence. Besides the name, the Spider was wanted by both 
        the law and the criminal underworld (a defining theme of Spider-Man's early years)
        and had through years of ceaseless struggle developed a "sixth sense", which warns 
        him of danger, the inspiration for Spider-Man's "spider-sense". In a multitude of 
        print and video interviews, Lee also says he was inspired by seeing a spider climb
        up a wallâ€”adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has
        become unsure of whether or not this is true
